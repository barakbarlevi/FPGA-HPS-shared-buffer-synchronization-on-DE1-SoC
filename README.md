# FPGA HPS shared buffer synchronization on DE1-SoC


Weâ€™ll have the FPGA (Cyclone V) write data to a 1MB ring buffer. Its writing may pause for an arbitrary amount of time, simulating it waiting on some other tasks to finish. A C program running on the HPS (which includes an ARM Cortex-A9 processor) will flawlessly retrieve data from the buffer and process it. No misses, no duplications.
